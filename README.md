# Healthcare-Translation-APP-using-Generative-AI
A web-based prototype that enables real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. This application should convert spoken input into text, provide a live transcript, and offer a translated version with audio playback.

This Healthcare Translation App provides real-time voice-to-text conversion, translation, and text-to
speech synthesis. It leverages machine learning models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5, Whisper for 
transcription, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for speech synthesis. The application allows healthcare 
providers and patients to communicate across multiple languages, ensuring accessibility and ease of 
interaction.
